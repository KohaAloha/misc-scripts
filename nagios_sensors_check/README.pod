=head1 nagios_sensors_check

=head2 DESCRIPTION

A simple Nagios plugin to monitor selected hardware sensors values
(temperatures, fan speeds, voltages) from the output of the lm_sensors
C<sensors> utility.

Allows you to select only the readings you want to monitor, and easily set
acceptable thresholds.

Avoids the headache of configuring lm_sensors to use sensible thresholds and
alarms.

Also, provides useful information so you can see what the values are, rather
than just "ok" or "alarm", as the standard Nagios C<check_sensors> plugin seems
to provide.
