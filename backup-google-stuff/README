backup-google-stuff.pl

A quick and dirty script I use to back up stuff from my Google account
(contacts, calendar, Google Reader subscriptions).

I figured I should share this after discussions on Twitter about backing up
stuff stored with Google, in case it's of help to others.

It's a Perl script that logs in to Google and exports stuff via Google's export
mechanisms.

It's fairly basic as I just rocked it up for my own use, but I may extend it in
future, make it easier to configure and use, and perhaps add support for backing
up other Google-hosted data (Google Plus, perhaps).

script with more flexibility by Kript - http://www.kript.net/wordpress/?p=667
