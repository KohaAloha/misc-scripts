A silly little script to practice quick mental arithmetic for darts scoring,
which I rather suck at.

Unfortunately I've spent too much of my life with a computer in front of me to
give me quick accurate answers, so when I chalk darts games, my mental
arithmetic can be painfully slow.

This was a quick fun script knocked together to practice :)
