A simple way to run Dancer applications  under Starman on Debian machines.

This was cobbled together for me own use, but I've put it here in case it's
useful to others.

Usage:

 - copy 'dancer'  to /etc/init.d and make it executable

 - run update-rc.d dancer defaults
   (This sets up symlinks to start/stop apps at boot/shutdown)

 - mkdir /etc/dancer
   (This dir contains app config files)

 - in /etc/dancer, create a file for each app, one per line, containing:
DIR=/path/to/myapp
SCRIPT=bin/app.pl
USER=davidp
PORT=5000  
PIDFILE=/var/run/site-$SITENAME.pid
