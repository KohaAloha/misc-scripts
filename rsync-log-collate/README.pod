=head1 rsync-log-collate

A simple script to process an rsync log file on STDIN, collate the log entries
by connection (using a combination of PID and remote hostname), then output
each one, so all lines for a given connection are togther rather than all 
interspersed.

=head2 USAGE

Simply pipe rsync logs into the script's STDIN:

    cat rsync.log | ./rsync-log-collate
